This repository contains the simulation code, model parameters, and analysis outputs from the study: “Patients with Newly Diagnosed Cervical Cancer Should Be Screened for Anal Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Anal Dysplasia: Results of Cost and Quality Analysis.” 

The model compares screened vs. unscreened cohorts over multiple time horizons, incorporating progression and regression of anal dysplasia, cancer mortality, costs, and QALYs. Results support the cost-saving and life-extending benefits of implementing anal HPV screening at the time of cervical cancer diagnosis.
